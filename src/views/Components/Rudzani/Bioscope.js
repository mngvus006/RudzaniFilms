      <h2>iBioscope yeCommunity – “Cinema for People’s Development” </h2>
					<h4>Is a Mobile Cinema or Travelling Cinema project. After 7 years of experimental implementation and praxis in the University of Limpopo, schools and surrounding community audiences, the concept has been redesigned, developed,  and improved. It is now theorized as an adapted systemic solution to address the great distribution and audience challenges faced by African filmmakers, and South African Black filmmakers in particular.  iBIOSCOPE YECOMMUNITY draws its inspiration from experiences, attempts and initiatives taken in the country related to audience development and distribution of films produced by Black South African filmmakers for their natural and real markets in townships, rural areas and schools. iBIOSCOPE YECOMMUNITY is designed to provide a solution to a problem created by a system of exclusion of black and poor communities in South Africa from accessing African Narrative films produced by black African filmmakers, particularly in South Africa. iBIOSCOPE YECOMMUNITY is also designed as a socio-economical business model with immediate and measurable social and economic impact on local beneficiaries,  in line with the National Radical transformation Vision and the Africa Agenda 2063.</h4>
				
                    <h4>The black South African filmmakers</h4>
					<h4>Are not able to take their films to their natural and real audiences in townships, rural areas and in schools. Many of them have encountered audience failure when releasing their films in the formal distribution circles. “Kalushi” is a perfect illustration of an opportunity lost. This is a great film by a black South African filmmaker, which wasn’t allowed to meet its real audience. Several other independent and private initiatives have been undertaken, of which most have also failed, and few are still trying to find their way without making the required or expected impact because only a systemic solution can successfully be applied to a systemic problem. 

Our inability to see ourselves on the big screen has led to a great deal of audience isolation. It has decreased the confidence of Black filmmakers in making not only stories that are creative, but also original. As a consequence, hereof, the African story’s importance and valid is brought to disrepute. This cultural event – iBioscope ye Community – Cinema for the people’s development, hopes to change the perception of the elitist cinema going culture by presenting an accessible cinema experience. </h4>
	
<h4>We are now taking the successful results from our experience by creating a national network of iBIOSCOPE YECOMMUNITIES in the country. This network will facilitate the long awaited easy access of black South African films in particular and African films generally to their natural audiences in townships, rural areas and schools while providing a platform for filmmakers to easily reach their local audiences in each province and each district of South Africa. The aim is for iBioscope to create a cinema going culture for African and South African films, and ultimately close the gap created by a colonial system, which ignored black audiences the right to watch films made for them, and also denied black filmmakers from accessing their natural audiences in townships, rural areas and schools.</h4>
